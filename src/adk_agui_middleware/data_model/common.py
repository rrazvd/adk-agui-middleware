    Defines the parameters for session lock acquisition, retry logic, and timeout
    handling to prevent concurrent access to session data. This configuration
    ensures proper session isolation and prevents race conditions in multi-request
    scenarios while providing graceful handling of lock contention.

    Attributes:

class InputInfo(BaseModel):
    """Container for processed input information and extracted context.

    Holds all the necessary information extracted from incoming requests and
    processed through context extractors. This model serves as a standardized
    container for passing request context throughout the middleware components,
    enabling consistent access to session identifiers, user context, and
    optional initial state data.

    This model is central to the middleware's operation as it carries the
    essential context needed for session management, agent execution, and
    HITL workflow orchestration.

    Attributes:
        agui_content: Original AGUI input containing messages and execution parameters
        request: HTTP request object containing headers and client information
        app_name: Application name extracted from request context for multi-tenant support
        user_id: User identifier extracted from request context for session isolation
        session_id: Session identifier for conversation persistence and state management
